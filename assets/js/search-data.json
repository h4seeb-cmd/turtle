            "content": "Data Compression . . This quiz was very quick for me, and honestly, the only really slightly challenging question was #3. I got the correct answer C, as although fewer bits may be stored, information is not necessarily lost when lossy compression is applied to an image. Additionally, the fact that it stores less bits makes the page render the info faster, I really just used basic logic here. . Extracting Information . . This quiz overall was pretty difficult, although I did get a 100% on it. Some of the hard questions were: . Question 1: I got the answer A. This was correct because the unique identifier would be required in order to distinguish between two students with the same first and last names. If that’s not there, the program would get confused. . Question 3: For this question, I get the answers B and C. This is because different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed. .",

            "content": "Haseeb Beg . Mrs. Paulson . HSE-3 . 26 September 2022 . Happy Essay . In this day and age, there are many ways to be truly fulfilled and happy. Two ways that people find happiness are by working on their passions and by having a positive impact on the world. . Working on your passions is one of the things in life that can truly fulfill someone and give them a true sense of happiness. One person who has lived by this sentiment is Ronaldo Fadul. He has rejected the world’s materialistic nature for a humble house on the beach where he surfs day in and day out for over 50 years now. He expresses that, “This is the life that I chose. This is not the life of a PhD, but I live well.” He doesn’t quite have as much money as Elon Musk, but he lives a life that he is passionate about, and that’s enough for him. He has stepped off the hedonic treadmill, and in stepping away from the dystopian materialism that has affected Western society, he has found solace. . Another example of honing a skill and focusing on passions is actually a personal example. What surfing is to Ronaldo Fadul, making music is to me. I find tranquility and peace within the confines of my headphones, when making music, it seems as if everything else fades away. It’s just me and the music, in a sense. The thoughts that plague my mind in my day to day life seem to be silenced and my mind is whisked away into a state of flow. This state of flow has helped me through any mental health problems that I have struggled with in the past. One example I can give was a couple weeks ago. I knew that school was starting soon, and whatever I thought about it, I had a sense of dread and anxiety that would just not go away. Even as I would try to sleep, I would think about all the things that could go wrong. My only way of escaping this sense of dread was with music. Whenever I would go onto my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to work on projects, I would feel a sense of tranquility. As a result, eventually my passion for music helped me overcome the anxiety that gripped me during the summer. The flow state I was constantly entering on the daily helped me focus more on the present and what is happening right in front of me. . Additionally, it is known that doing acts of kindness and having a positive impact on the world is amazing for one’s mental health. A prime example of this is Andy Wimmer, who works at the Home for the Dying and Destitute in Kolkata, India. He has been helping people for 17 years and before his time in India, he was a rich banker. He lived a normal life, and he was quite into fashion. He spent lots of money on clothes, and materialistic things. However, when he was introduced to the Home for the Dying and Destitute, he thought that there must be more to life than a big house and a fast car. He started living in India and regularly volunteering, and he is living out his intrinsic goals. This is yet another example of people rejecting materialism and how it has made them happier. . Another example of the link between being kind and being happy was found in a study conducted by Kathyrn E. Buchanan and Anat Bardi in 2009. According to berkeley.edu, the study was conducted by sorting 86 participants into three groups for ten days and measuring their life satisfaction via survey before and after the study period. Group one was instructed to do at least one genuinely kind thing every day. Group two was instructed to do something new each day, and group three was not instructed to do anything. At the end of the study, it was found that after being surveyed, groups one and two had roughly equal increases in happiness. Even though group one only had to do one kind thing every day, they managed to feel the same amount of happiness as the group who were constantly doing new things. Additionally, both groups were focused on more intrinsic goals, and that’s why the happiness in the study grew. . Now looking back at this evidence, it’s no wonder that the general population has gotten unhappier and unhappier. If the American Dream of having a big house and fast cars was really the peak of the human experience, if money really was the key to happiness, then why did the suicide rate in the United States soar by 30 percent? .",

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

            "title": "Collegeboard MCQ 3 Corrections/Reflection",
            "content": "Proof of Completion: . . Test Corrections: . Question 21: . The correct answer was actually C, as this code is flawed due to the nature of the FOR EACH loop. The way this is strucutred, the first term is actually added up twice. Since the first term in this case is 0, the sum is not affected, as you are simply adding 0 twice. However any non-zero starting point would alter the sum and mess everything up. I failed to see this and that is why I clicked A. . Question 22: . To be honest, I completely missed the bottom code block and the fact that it is not nested, so it should run after it checks for rotating left and right. My original logic was that it would always just keep on rotating, but after further examining the code, I can see why this is not the case. However, for grid 2, the code won’t work because there are two paths for the computer to go, and it chooses to go right instead of left due to the ordering of the code blocks. . Question 29: . I did not understand this problem all that well, and I am still sort of unfamiliar with the way Collegeboard psuedocode assigns variables. However from what I can gather, the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables. . Question 33: . To be honest this was a dumb error. I thought that by repeat once it meant that it would .,run once, then repeat one more time, however I missed that the code running once counts as ONE repeat. Just a nomenclature error but I had the same idea as the correct answer, so not much to correct here. . Reflection . I believe I am getting much stronger at some of the logic questions, however there are still some technicalities that got me this time around. The wording was very strange on some of these problems, but overall I am starting to see myself achieving mastery on most of these topics. .",

The video showcases my program, which encompasses the following. The program displays the score, the question, and the list of options. The list of options is pulled from a backend API that has the question, answer, and incorrect answers. If the option clicked and submitted has the same text as the correct answer it will add 1 point. If the user hits submit without clicking anything, the program will prompt the user to click an option. If an incorrect answer was clicked, the program will alert the user about what the right answer was and restart the game. If 10 questions are answered correctly consecutively, than the program will return “You Win!” . 3.a.iii . The input and output of this program, as showcased in my video, is based around the various buttons that are on the screen. The user clicks an option, then clicks submit. The program will then check whether or not the answer is correct. After doing this, the program will output whether or not the user got the answer right, then it will either add a point and load the next question or alert the user about what the right answer is and restart the game. . 3b . 3.b.i . . 3.b.ii . Once the API data is recieved it displays the data with this code snippit. . 3.b.iii . The program pulls correctAnswer, incorrectAnswer1, incorrectAnswer2, incorrectAnswer3, and question from the nested list (qAs) that the backend stores (as shown in image 1), and once the API data is recieved it displays the data with the showQuestion() function, as shown in image 2. . 3.b.iv . The data in the list represents the different questions that could be shown to the user. . 3.b.v . The nested list here manages complexity because it keeps all the question data very neatly organized, and it stores each question (each of which have attributes), with a variable. Then, it just plugs in those variables into another list. Without this system, not only would the code be much messier, but it may not even function, as the attributes are being stored in an sqlite table. Incorrect formmating and not using best practice here would destroy the sqlite table. If one wanted to add another question to the pool of possible questions, they would simply need to create another variable with the attributes, then plug said variable into the qAs list. . 3c . 3.c.i . . 3.c.ii . . 3.c.iii . The procedure checkAnswer is responsible for validating the user input, and whether or not an answer was even clicked before submitting. This is important for the program because this is what validates garbage and what distinguishes good input from bad input. This also is a core mechanic of the game, as the user must get 10 questions right consecutively to win. . 3.c.iv . The procedure starts by checking whether or not an answer was clicked, if false, the procedure will immediately output “Please click an option.”, if an option is selected then the procedure will check exactly what was selected and submitted. If the input is equal to the correct answer as defined in the API, then it will return “Correct Answer”, and it will add 1 point to the total score, it will then load the next random question. If the input is incorrect, then the procedure will return an output of “Wrong Answer! Correct Answer: * insert correct answer here *.” The procedure will then restart the game. . 3d . 3.d.i . showing calls being made (take before and after screenshots of clicking and showing answrs) . 3.d.ii . What’s being tested in these calls is the validity of the user’s answer. If the answer submitted is the same as correctAnswer in the API, a point is given and a new question is loaded. If the answer is incorrect, the procedure will return an output of “Wrong Answer! Correct Answer: * insert correct answer here *.” The procedure will then restart the game. . 3.diii . result of said calls .",

PII can be made up of a variety of different kinds of data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, bank codes, and more. PII can also include information about a person’s health, locaiton, etc. In our projects we used a database in order to store user data. This data can be seen as PII. We have also seen personal information when signing up for services that we use such as accounts for Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc, which store emails, phone numbers, often address and other information while setting up the tools that we use to create our projects. | . Feeling PII &amp; Personal Exposure . I believe that PII is necessary for user data and accounts, amd is one of the few ways that users can be validated. . Good Vs. Bad Password . A good password is one that is random and hard to guess. They often times are not things like birthdays, or names, as they could be socially engineered and cracked. Good passwords are also full of random, complex, and full of random obscure symbols. This makes it hard for hackers to brute force guess your password. Also, it’s good to have different passwords for different websites. . Symmetric &amp; Asymmetric Encryption . Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This is the most common type of encryption, as it is used for most password encryption systems. This means that there is a faster encryption and decryption process as the same key is used for both. Example Symmetric Encryption: AES, DES, 3DES, etc. . Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption where there are two distinct keys, a public and private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used to decrypt the data. This is the type of encryption that we used for our GitHub fastpages blog. Example Asymmetric Encryption: RSA, ECC, etc. . AWS Deployment . We used private and public SSH keys while deploying our project to AWS. We also created a .pem file that we used to look into our instance. We didn’t do much else in terms of encryption after that, as anything else was for hte most part, beyond us. . How I got Phished . When I was 5, I was contacted by a ‘Nigerian Prince’ via email. He said that I won 50,000 dollars! I was so hyped because I thought it was real. One catch however, I needed to pay the shipping fee of $50, makes sense because he was from Nigeria, or at least I thought. I took my dad’s credit card and I payed up, not knowing it was a scam. He never replied after he got the money, and I obviously didn’t get my ‘prize’. Once my dad found out, lets just say I didn’t get any birthday presents that year… .",

Licensing Various Projects and Repositories . For adding a new license, I added the MIT license to my personal repository and group frontend/backend. This makes it so that it’s closed source, and now people who use any of the code will have to credit my group and I, whether that be a shout out, or something in the project description. As for applying the license, it was very easy. I simply made a file, called it LICENSE, then selected the license of choice. Then it prompted me to commit my changes, so I did that.

For the approximately 150 students in AP Computer Science Principles, one crowdsourcing idea could be a GitHub-esque site with people offering various bits of code on the site. It’ll kind of work like a blog, but everyone can add their own posts. As for a project idea that uses crowdsourcing, we could have an absolutely massive project, with the entire class working on it. This would force the entire class to crowdsource and work together. . Crowdsourcing in ProjectNASH . As it pertains to my group’s project, crowdsourcing can actually be very helpful. To make our project better, we could use crowdsourcing to get more games in the arcade! This crowdsourcing could also help us build a more robust frontend for the website! . Data Captured at N@ATM . One idea I have for capturing data at Night At The Museum could be a suggestions and likes page. We could make a form, and have spectators fill it out. Once they submit it, the data will go into a database, and we will have a comprehensive table of data for what the people want/like. We could then make a “revised” version with the most highly reccomended features. If this ends up being too much for us, we could simply use a Google Form and Google Spreadsheet. .",

            "content": "Task 1 . Overall, I believe that a lot of bias is unintentional, and many people can take it the wrong way. For example, people made a huge deal about Siri’s voice being a woman, as they thought Apple was trying to say that women are only good at supporting men. However, this point is completely moot as there are options to change Siri’s voice. Additionally, if Siri’s voice was a man, these same people would say that they made the voice a man as if to say that men should be the ones doing all the important jobs. As for algorithm bias, I believe that companies check their user statistics, and they purposely target users with things like reccomendations and advertisements based on the data that they were provided. . Task 2 . I believe that this bias was not intentional on HP’s part. This is because cameras are not as good at detecting and focusing on faces of color anyway. Due to the darker skin tone, some low-budget cameras, like the one installed in the laptop, don’t detect exposure as well. This causes the facial tracking system to not work as well on people with darker skin. This problem could have been easily avoided if they gave the facial tracking systemm more skin tones to test with, and with further testing, this problem could be solved. . How I Will Avoid Bias In My Code . As for how I will avoid bias in my code, I plan to do lots of testing and tuning before Night At The Museum, as not only will this help me debug my project, but it will also help avoid any sort of unintentional bias. .",

Computers are a massive advantage in society today, and it’s kind of like a haves and have nots type of thing | People may not have access to computers and the internet like others do for a myriad of reasons, some being: Economic situation | Country regulations | Family regulations | . | Some people choose to not use technology, as they believe it ruins society. | . Hacks . 1) How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? . In this digital era, people can empower themselves with relative ease, especially when it comes to fields involving computer science. In order to empower yourself, you must experiment and try new things, as there are so many different fields and opportunities available that there will be SOMETHING that interests you. After finding your interest, you must train to excel at that one niche. . 2) How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . I believe that the empowered can help the un-empowered via many different ways. The way that I would go about it is having a conversation with the un-empowered person. I would give them advice about struggles I went through, and what I did to solve my problems. I would also help them find something they are interested in, and I would help them experiment. This would launch a chain reaction of the person who previously wasn’t empowered to become empowered and help more un-empowered people. . 3) Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Although paper may be limiting digital empowerment in a sense, there is advantages to paper against computers. For one, paper is more reliabale and set in stone, as the paper doesn’t need to “save” and such. Del Norte still users paper for the majority of academic uses, as it’s exponentially harder to cheat on paper than on the computer. Especially in a school where cheating and academic dishonesty is held at such high regard. . 4) What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . I believe that as technology gets better and better, the divide between the haves and have-nots will increase further. Going hand in hand with the increase of the gap between the rich and the poor, the divide between the people who have technology and the people who don’t have technology will get exponentially larger. Technology will become more of an advantage, and the people who don’t have it will be pushed farther and farther away from the others. . Reflection . This lesson alerted me to the growing issue of digital divide. The overwhelming advantage of people who can use technology is scary, and that advantage is only going to get bigger. In order to solve this problem, we will need to make technology way more affordable and accessible to others. .",

            "content": "Proof of Completion: . . Test Corrections: . Question 1: . I got this answer wrong becasue the values for A would technically work, as it would just display the value of z. The correct answer is D. I am still a little confused as to why it is this way, so I will be studying up on the suggested topic. . Question 2: . I chose the answer B because I thought that what was stopping the code from working was the lack of code denoting an index. Although now, I can see the correct answer is C, because as it stands, every time the loop runs it sets the count variable to 0, creating an infinite loop. In order to fix this, you need to set the statement on line 5 to between lines 2 and 3. . Question 8: . I got this answer wrong for two reasons. For one, I didn’t click two answers, and secondly, the one answer I did click was incorrect. The correct answers were A and D. A was correct because if the difference between the two variables was 0, then that would mean the values are exactly the same. The same sort of logic goes for D, where if you add up the two, the answer should be a positive even number. . Question 13: . This question was wrong because the age could be 18 years old exactly for 1. The correct answers were 2 and 3 because those two correctly eliminate all other possibilities. . Question 24: . I got this question wrong because changing n wouldn’t change the amount of times the loop is ran exponentially. The best way I could explain it is by imagining n as 2 for example. After setting n to 2, the inner loop will repeat 2 times, while the outer loop will repeat 3 times. The code will run a total of 3 * 2 times, or 6 times. This is why the correct answer is 3n. . Question 36: . I got this wrong because if target does not appear in a list, the program will accurately display the value 0. The value of count is initialized to 0, and it never changes in the program if target does not appear in the list. A is correct because the variable count is initially set to 0 and is incremented only when the current item in the list (represented by the variable n) equals the value of the variable target. . Question 41: . I got one of the answers, however because I was in a rush I missed the second answer. The se . Reflection . Overall, I show a decently strong understanding of all the concepts, I just need to review the Collegeboard concepts. Some things I need to work on are not rushing towards the end, as I missed questions because I was in a hurry. Additionally, I need to review the concept of nested loops, as I have a feeling that it is going to be a reoccuring topic on the AP Exam. In order to do better on the AP Exam, I will need to actually watch the Collegeboard videos, as they go over the topics that I had a lack of understanding of duirng the test. Also, I could definetely be a little faster on the questions pretaining to the drawings. I did end up getting them right, but not without spending lots of time trying to visualize everything. .",

Collegeboard seems to grade a lot harder than I initially thought. They seem to be very picky on the explanation, and it’s not about what the code is, but more so how the student explalins the code. .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

World leader in serving science. . | Greater than 100,000 colleagues | 7000 R&amp;D scientists/engineers | $1.5B invested in Reaserch and Development | Greater than $40B in revenue | . Kris John: Software Engineer - SRE, DevOps . How it started: . Livermore High School, enjoyed STEM courses | Enrolled at UCLA for Electrical Engineering | Focussed on Communication Systems and Computer Networking | First Comp Sci Class (CS 31) Failed Research: . | Center for Embedded Network Sensors | Networked Informechanical Systems (NIMS) | Introduced to the Linux Operating System, Software Development Life Cycle (LEARNING LINUX IS A MARKETABLE SKILL) | . In 2008, Finished Graduate School, stock market had crashed. In 2010, systems engineer at a start up, GPM. NBC Universal in 2012, NBC Universal, Streaming media infrastructure. In 2014, worked at Qualcomm. Worked DevOps and stayed in the company for 6 years Currently working at Twitter. . Continuous Learning -Highlights . CCNA Training | Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Qualcomm) | Self Taught Python (Udemy) | Data Structures, Algorithms | Twitter University (basically showing you the ropes to working on twt) | . Some Projects I Worked On: . Streaming Media Infrastructure for the 2012 Olympic Games | Analytics Infrastructure Projects (LocationSmart, Qualcomm) | Twitter Projects New DataCenter Deployment | MigratingHome | . | Student Q&amp;A . Have you used AGILE and how has it been good? KJ: It depends what company you are in, they have their own variation. Notably, QC uses AGILE to plan out the quarter’s work. KB: AGILE is very useful for working in short, productive sprints. . Are you still working at Twitter even amidst current events? KJ: No, however, I am moving to work at Mystic Labs. Half the entire company was layed off. JM: When companies shuffle leadership, it’s good to look for jobs before the layoffs actually happen. That’s why KJ has a job lined up. . Is Machine Learning useful in the real world? KJ: It’s good to learn how to use Python libraries adn other machine learning frameworks. KB: Data scientists acutally work to combine data libraries. One of the products my division sells is a service that predicts demand for what certain products will be. . What do you think is the most important skill to have in the tech industry? KJ: The one that I have found is the most useful over time is continuous learning. In school, you are learning how to learn, and everyone has a differnt way of doing even the most basic things. We need to adapt. Another good skill is to not be super concerned about things you see in the news. To be resilient. If you are resilient in tech, you will prevail in terms of jobs. KB: Adapting is key. Carrer paths are not always linear, and my personal career path has been more of a zig-zag. The best people I have worked with listen to the requirements and they translate it in a way that technology can fufill. . What are the biggest challenges in the tech industry and how did you overcome it? KB: I have spent near than 14 years at QC and they work wtih semiconductors. And semiconductors were in a phase of aquisitions. You need to be able to adapt. KJ: Interviews nowadays are ridculous. The interviews are more of a series of timed tests now, and you don’t know what the problems are. You need to be able to pass those tests, and those tests are HARD. You will need to solve the problems using code, and the code has to work. . ??? KJ: It varies across the industry. When talking to the company, often you have the option to negotiate, after all you have the skills they want. However some companies are less lenient. . What happened at Twitter University? KJ: Twitter is not the only company that does this. Often times their methods and software are proprietary. You need to be able to be effective at your job so they teach you in the ways of their company. Companies often have their own build tools, and you have to be able to navigate the tools and use the tools. . How do you think leearning how to code helps in a buisness setting? KB: I would say that learning how to code is a way of thinking. It greatly helps your problem solving and critical thinking. When I interview, it’s for critical thinking and problem solving, why did you reach the conclusion? Learning how to code helps you think more methodically. . How will you use continuous learning in your next job? (Question aimed at KJ) KJ: My next role makes me intrested in things like blockchain tech. .",

Libararies . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;import&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from math import sqrt as m from random import randint as rd print(m(rd(1,10))) . 2.0 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle!

Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; rainy = false; . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . false . The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . false . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 .

Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure? . Correct answer: B, Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed. . Question 17: . Purpose of Internet protocols: . Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet? . Correct answer: D, Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . Question 43: . Value of x after REPEAT UNTIL block: . Consider the following code segment. . x ← 0 result ← 0 REPEAT UNTIL x is greater than 5 result ← result plus x x ← x plus 1 . What is the value of result after the code segment is executed? . Correct answer: C, The variables x and result are initialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop terminates when x exceeds 5. Therefore, result is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15. . Question 45: .

What are the values of count1 and count2 as a result of executing the code segment? . Correct answer: B, The code segment iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise.

One problem that was discussed in this presentation was that of the unfair treatment of women in STEM fields. Even in the year 2022, some companies do not take women seriously. There have even been scandals recently about companies like Activision-Blizzard harrassing women and treating them horribly. Engineering sees no gender, no concept of race, but rather, someone’s creativity and problem solving ability. . What Should I Do to Get Into a Good CS University? . Someone in the meeting asked a question regarding good CS universities and what to do in order to get into them. The response was what I expected for the most part. CS based extracurriculars and experience along with a good show of academic excellence and rigor would be ideal. I should try to find CS classes I can take at local community colleges.

Staying curious is the key to bringing new, innovative things to the table. This desire to learn new things and implementing new ways of using said things is crucial. This leads into never giving up, as if you give up when the going gets tough, how will you find the new, innovative things. Bill Gates would not have made Microsoft if he had given up halfway through because “it was too hard” or “it had a very little chance of success.” Lastly, while invention is creating an entirely new thing, innovation is the proccess of refining said thing. .",

Notes from College Board 1.2 . Video Notes Computer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text). Programs are mostly event-driven –&gt; events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program. Input affects output of a program. Outputs can be visual, audio,touch/feel(vibrations), text, etc. A program (aka software) is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment. To describe a code segment, first state what it does, and then include how it does it. . Learning Objectives CRD - 2.A - Describe the purpose of a computing innovation. CRD - 2.A.1 - The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.

Notes Different innovations are contained under different categories of innovations . Program inputs are pecies of data that are sent to computers for processing and interpretation. The computer will then perform operations and manipulate teh data in order to produce a desirable. Inputs can either come from the user themselves, or from another program. . Every event in a program is associated with an action that supplies an input to the program. . Event Driven Programming: Program segments and code fragments are executed based on events that trigger specific control flow structures rather an a smooth, sequential flow. . A program is a collection of software statements that collectively serves a specific use and performs a certain task. . The program works for a variety of inputs and situations.

Research, Designing, Prototyping, Testing, followed by revisions. Revisions are a key part of this process and will happen several times. This developmental process is iterative and requires refinement and revision based on testing and feedback. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. Investigation is useful in development for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the requirements of the people who will use the program. Investigation can be perfomed by collecting user data, having beta testing, interviews, and direct observations. . Learning Objectives CRD - 2.E - Develop a program using a development process. CRD - 2.F - Design a program and its user interface CRD - 2.E.1 - A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature. CRD - 2.E.2 - There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: . Investigating and reflecting Designing Prototyping Testing CRD - 2.E.3 - A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. CRD - 2.F.1 - The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. CRD - 2.F.2 - Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. CRD - 2.F.3 - Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: . Collecting data through surveys User testing Interviews CRD - 2.F.4 - Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. CRD - 2.F.5 - A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. CRD - 2.F.6 - In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. CRD - 2.F.7 - The design phase of a program may include: . Brainstorming Planning and storyboarding Organizing the program into modules and functional components Creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface Development of a testing strategy for the program . Notes from College Board 1.4 . Common Errors: To start, it’s important to note that no one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program; Logic, Syntax, Run-time, and Overflow errors. . Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn’t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as “crashing” and the error is normally referred to as a “bug”. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data. . Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program’s language, resulting in restrictions. . Methods to Correct Errors: IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn’t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. .",

For one, it was something I am not entirely familiar with, as I have had very little exposure and I have never actually used it for anything. Due to this sense of unfamiliarity, figuring out the logic behind certain pieces of code was very challenging for me. . - The Word Problems . Additionally, I found that the word problems were also challenging for me. It felt like they were extremely bloated and there was some useless information for the purpose of throwing me off. . Overall Thoughts . I think that I will definetely need to train myself to learn the CollegeBoard psuedocode a little bit more, as that will for sure show up on the AP exam. Additionally, I will have to get better at seeing the logic in code. In order to do that I must practice to analyze different pieces of code to pick apart their funciton. I should also strive to get better at the word problems, as they gave me quite a lot of trouble. .",

            "content": "Haseeb Beg . Mrs. Paulson . HSE-3 . 26 September 2022 . Happy Essay . In this day and age, there are many ways to be truly fulfilled and happy. Two ways that people find happiness are by working on their passions and by having a positive impact on the world. . Working on your passions is one of the things in life that can truly fulfill someone and give them a true sense of happiness. One person who has lived by this sentiment is Ronaldo Fadul. He has rejected the world’s materialistic nature for a humble house on the beach where he surfs day in and day out for over 50 years now. He expresses that, “This is the life that I chose. This is not the life of a PhD, but I live well.” He doesn’t quite have as much money as Elon Musk, but he lives a life that he is passionate about, and that’s enough for him. He has stepped off the hedonic treadmill, and in stepping away from the dystopian materialism that has affected Western society, he has found solace. . Another example of honing a skill and focusing on passions is actually a personal example. What surfing is to Ronaldo Fadul, making music is to me. I find tranquility and peace within the confines of my headphones, when making music, it seems as if everything else fades away. It’s just me and the music, in a sense. The thoughts that plague my mind in my day to day life seem to be silenced and my mind is whisked away into a state of flow. This state of flow has helped me through any mental health problems that I have struggled with in the past. One example I can give was a couple weeks ago. I knew that school was starting soon, and whatever I thought about it, I had a sense of dread and anxiety that would just not go away. Even as I would try to sleep, I would think about all the things that could go wrong. My only way of escaping this sense of dread was with music. Whenever I would go onto my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to work on projects, I would feel a sense of tranquility. As a result, eventually my passion for music helped me overcome the anxiety that gripped me during the summer. The flow state I was constantly entering on the daily helped me focus more on the present and what is happening right in front of me. . Additionally, it is known that doing acts of kindness and having a positive impact on the world is amazing for one’s mental health. A prime example of this is Andy Wimmer, who works at the Home for the Dying and Destitute in Kolkata, India. He has been helping people for 17 years and before his time in India, he was a rich banker. He lived a normal life, and he was quite into fashion. He spent lots of money on clothes, and materialistic things. However, when he was introduced to the Home for the Dying and Destitute, he thought that there must be more to life than a big house and a fast car. He started living in India and regularly volunteering, and he is living out his intrinsic goals. This is yet another example of people rejecting materialism and how it has made them happier. . Another example of the link between being kind and being happy was found in a study conducted by Kathyrn E. Buchanan and Anat Bardi in 2009. According to berkeley.edu, the study was conducted by sorting 86 participants into three groups for ten days and measuring their life satisfaction via survey before and after the study period. Group one was instructed to do at least one genuinely kind thing every day. Group two was instructed to do something new each day, and group three was not instructed to do anything. At the end of the study, it was found that after being surveyed, groups one and two had roughly equal increases in happiness. Even though group one only had to do one kind thing every day, they managed to feel the same amount of happiness as the group who were constantly doing new things. Additionally, both groups were focused on more intrinsic goals, and that’s why the happiness in the study grew. . Now looking back at this evidence, it’s no wonder that the general population has gotten unhappier and unhappier. If the American Dream of having a big house and fast cars was really the peak of the human experience, if money really was the key to happiness, then why did the suicide rate in the United States soar by 30 percent? .",

It would also play nice, calming music in the background. It would also be cool if I could add a function to let the user play their own songs on the site by linking it to spotify. The equations . College Board Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this calculator is to assist people with mathematical calculations. The calculator will be robust, and the site will work seamlessly, to provide the user with the best experience possible. . Data Abstraction . The data that will be stored is the integers inputed by the user. Once they hit the calculate button, the code will compile the user data and calculate the output. Additionally, the site will allow users to sign into their spotify. It will use this information to let the user play whatever song they want on the site, provided they sign in. . Managing Complexity . Ideally, my calculator should be able to calculate semi-complex equations using order of operations and print out the output. Adding the order of operations into the mix would spike up the complexity of the code. Additionally, the option to sign in to a Spotify account and play music would prove to be quite complex as well. . Procedural Abstraction . The code will abstract user data from what they inputted, and it will also collect the user’s Spotify details so that they can access their music playlists and play songs from the website UI. This will make the calculator more personalized, and it would add another level of depth to the project. . Algorithm Implementation . The main algorithm in this website would work to calculate the solution to the equations users would input. There will be a secondary algorithm that will pull user data in order to let them access their Spotify from the calculator. . Testing . In order to test my idea, I will screen record myself going through every function. . Learning Preperation . In order to create this idea, I need to learn about: . Integrations with other sites | How to implement an order to the code’s math | How to further customize webpages | . Ideas . Fallback ideas if the calculator project hits the fan: . More refined quiz game | 2-D platfoming game | .",

I added a mix bag of questions that vary from CS terminology to mathematical questions. Some challenges I faced while working were: . Not having my score tallied correctly at the end card | Hitting submit indiscriminately sent you to the correct screen, regardless of answer | Suffering from organizational issues | . In order to overcome these challenges, I had to do lots of debugging. For one, I labled most of the components in my quiz, as my lack of organization really started to weigh me down later on. In order to fix the submit button only sending you to the correct screen, I had to use the getText code to run a check through the user input. . Improvements I Should Keep in Mind for the Future . Some things I could have done better were: . Make the quiz more visually appealing | Manage my work time better | Write better, more robust code | . Thoughts on AppLab . I feel like AppLab is a great concept and tool for those taking their first steps into CS, but I feel like because it’s not using an actual language, there’s not a lot of room for going above and beyond. Looking for ways to improve my code, and advice as to how to do certain things online was nigh impossible, as there isn’t too much documentation on the way AppLab works at a higher level. At the end of the day, this feels like a Dollar Tree, less robust version of Scratch. .",

As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database.

These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;GPA:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;GPA&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 GPA: 4 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 GPA: Over 9000 Cars: 4Runner . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 GPA: 4 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 GPA: Over 9000 Cars: 4Runner . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 GPA: 4 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 GPA: Over 9000 Cars: 4Runner . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",
