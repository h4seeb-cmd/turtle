Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of red, green, and blue can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity. Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed) Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms Variables: Values that can change, depending on the conditions and code written. Often assigned by the programmer. Data Types: A particular kind of data item, can be defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it. Assignment Operators: Used to assign values, functions, and variables to something. Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists: A sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name. 2D Lists: A two-dimensional list can also be used to store objects, which is especially convenient for programming sketches that involve some sort of “grid” or “board” Dictionaries: A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value Class: Extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior Algorithms: Step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions that must be carried out in a specific order to produce the desired result Sequence: Order that commands are executed by a computer, allows us to carry out tasks that have multiple steps Selection: Programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met Iteration: Sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved Expressions: A combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value Comparison Operators: Operators that compare two expressions and return a Boolean value that represents the relationship of their values Booleans Expressions and Selection: Ture or false, compares data of any type as long as types are the same. Booleans Expressions and Iteration: and/or, not. Truth Tables: a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. You can produce truth tables for parts of a circuit to check the logic at any stage. Characters: Display unit of information equating to one alphabetic letter or symbol Strings: Traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable Length: Code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits Concatenation: Means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings If: A conditional statement that only runs the code specified unless the defined conditons are met Else: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false Elif: used in conditional statements (if statements), and is short for else if Nested Selection Statements: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task Traversing Strings: To traverse a string means to accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript. A string can be traversed using for loop or while loop. Upper: Upper bounds of a function Lower: Lower bounds of a fucntion Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements Python For: A statement that is used to repeatedly execute code as long as the condition is satisfied. While loops with Range: A loop that itereates through the code specified in it’s body Combining loops with conditionals to Break: Continue: Code that is written when the programmer wants to force the program to move on Procedural Abstraction: Breaking up code in different pieces to add modularity with procedures Python Def procedures: Def is used when defining a function/procedure in python Parameters: Input values that help functions and procedures know what values to work with. Return Values: What a procedure gives as an output/resut.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My First Notebook</title><link href="https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/fastpages/jupyter/week%200/2022/12/09/first-notebook.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My First Notebook" /><published>2022-12-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/fastpages/jupyter/week%200/2022/12/09/first-notebook</id><author><name>Haseeb Beg</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="jupyter" /><category term="Week 0" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have spent far too long on this...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy Essay</title><link href="https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/2022/12/09/Happy-Essay.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Happy Essay" /><published>2022-12-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/2022/12/09/Happy-Essay</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haseeb Beg]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Homework</title><link href="https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/week%2013/2022/11/30/homework.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Homework" /><published>2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-11-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://h4seeb-cmd.github.io/turtle/week%2013/2022/11/30/homework</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Week 13" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
