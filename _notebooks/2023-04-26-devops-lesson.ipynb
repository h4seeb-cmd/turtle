    "Without CORS, API requests are not possible, as API requests use Cross Origin requests.\n",

    "# KASM Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of \"sudo\" when running commands in terminal?\n",
    "sudo is used to provide admin access in order to run certain commands in bash.\n",
    "2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as?\n",
    "The df command provides information about the amount of free and used disk space on each file system that is mounted, while du displays the disk usage of files and directories. On the other hand, lsblk lists details about all the available or specific devices on the system.\n",
    "3. What do you think are some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" to get the zip file for KASM?\n",
    "wget allows the user to download the zip file directly into the desired directory.\n",
    "4. What kind of commands do you think the \"install.sh\" command has and why is it necessary to call it?\n",
    "It is possible that the \"install.sh\" command consists of instructions for the installation and setup of KASM on the server. These instructions could involve the downloading and extracting the KASM zip file, setting up any prerequisites required, and configuring the KASM service to automatically start up. To ensure the proper installation and configuration of KASM, executing the \"install.sh\" command is necessary.\n",
    "5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide.\n",
    "In order to deploy KASM, it might be necessary to first configure firewall rules in order to permit communication to and from the KASM service. Next is setting up SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication, and managing user accounts and permissions. As a side note, the integration of KASM with other security tools such as IDS/IPS or SIEM systems can potentially boost its functionalities and offer a more complete security solution. To expand the guide to encompass these topics, one can add sections on firewall configuration, SSL/TLS certificates, user administration, and integration of KASM with other security tools.\n",
