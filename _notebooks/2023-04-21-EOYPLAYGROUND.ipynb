    "- The Game of Life: Takes place on a rectangular board with a grid on it, and each cell of the grid is either alive or dead.\n",
    "- Connect 4: A traditional game that requires two players involves dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid, taking turns one after the other. The objective is to get a sequence of four discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does. The player who accomplishes this first wins the game."

    "# Lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lists are collections of data that have a specific order. They can contain various types of data, such as strings, numbers, or objects, and are denoted by square brackets with commas separating each element. On the other hand, dictionaries are unordered collections of information. They are created using curly brackets and consist of key-value pairs, where a key uniquely identifies a value. Values can take on any data type, including strings, numbers, and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In general:\n",
    "    - Lists tend to be faster at indexing.\n",
    "    - Dictionaries are more robust at accessing keys and values.\n",
    "    - Lists can store duplicate values, however dictionaries cannot."
