# Proof of Completion:

# Things I Found Difficult:

## - The Pseudo-Code
I found that working with the psuedo-code proved to be a challenge for many reasons. For one, it was something I am not entirely familiar with, as I have had very little exposure and I have never actually used it for anything. Due to this sense of unfamiliarity, figuring out the logic behind certain pieces of code was very challenging for me.

## - The Word Problems
Additionally, I found that the word problems were also challenging for me. It felt like they were extremely bloated and there was some useless information for the purpose of throwing me off. 

# Overall Thoughts
I think that I will definetely need to train myself to learn the CollegeBoard psuedocode a little bit more, as that will for sure show up on the AP exam. Additionally, I will have to get better at seeing the logic in code. In order to do that I must practice to analyze different pieces of code to pick apart their funciton. I should also strive to get better at the word problems, as they gave me quite a lot of trouble.
