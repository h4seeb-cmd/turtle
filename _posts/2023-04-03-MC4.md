# Corrections

### Question 3
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ4Q3.png)

My answer was wrong as while removing four links could isolate computer F from computer E, 4 is not the minimum number required to accomplish this. 3 was correct, as Aay line between two computers represents a way for them to communicate with each other, and a communication between two computers can go through other computers. If the links from F to G, from F to A, and from F to E were broken, it would not be possible for computers E and F to communicate.

### Question 17

My answer was incorrect, as in order to answer this question, the data set would need to include information from students with majors other than computer science and would need to store each student’s major. B was the correct choice, as the data set stores information about an individual student’s gender and state. This information can be aggregated to extract information about the percentage of female majors in each state.

### Question 21

My answer was wrong, as this question can be answered by filtering the people and society category that provides the number of requests for a certain political candidate. The correct answer was choice C, as the cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

### Question 37

My answer was wrong, as it is correct that as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2, however, that means the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. The correct answer is B, because as n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2 , which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n^2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time.

### Question 39

My answer was wrong, as the first number displayed must be 1. The second number displayed could be 1 or 2. The third number displayed could be 1, 2, or 3. The last number displayed could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 1 1 1 1 is a possible output. The correct answer is D, as in the second iteration of the loop, i is equal to 2. Thus RANDOM(1, i) returns either 1 or 2. So, the output 1 3 2 4 is not possible.
