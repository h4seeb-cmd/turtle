# My Theme Changing Experience

I was wondering what Turtle would look like under a new coat of paint, and I decided that I wanted to try out a new theme! I ended up choosing the theme Midnight, and this is how it turned out:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/midnight-theme.png "What it looks like")

I noticed that my home page broke, and all my subpages were gone. The font changed and on top of that, I had to hide all my custom css to get the layout to function. It added some new text that wasn't there before and the color scheme completely changed.
