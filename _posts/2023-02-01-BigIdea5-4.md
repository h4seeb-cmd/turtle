### CSP Crowdsourcing Idea
For the approximately 150 students in AP Computer Science Principles, one crowdsourcing idea could be a GitHub-esque site with people offering various bits of code on the site. It'll kind of work like a blog, but everyone can add their own posts. As for a project idea that uses crowdsourcing, we could have an absolutely massive project, with the entire class working on it. This would force the entire class to crowdsource and work together.

### Crowdsourcing in ProjectNASH
As it pertains to my group's project, crowdsourcing can actually be very helpful. To make our project better, we could use crowdsourcing to get more games in the arcade! This crowdsourcing could also help us build a more robust frontend for the website!

### Data Captured at N@ATM
One idea I have for capturing data at Night At The Museum could be a suggestions and likes page. We could make a form, and have spectators fill it out. Once they submit it, the data will go into a database, and we will have a comprehensive table of data for what the people want/like. We could then make a "revised" version with the most highly reccomended features. If this ends up being too much for us, we could simply use a Google Form and Google Spreadsheet.
