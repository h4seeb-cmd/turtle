# Problem 1:

DineOutHelper is a mobile application that people can use to select a restaurant for a group meal. Each user creates a profile with a unique username and a list of food allergies or dietary restrictions. Each user can then build a contact list of other users of the app.

A user who is organizing a meal with a group selects all the members of the group from the user's contact list. The application then recommends one or more nearby restaurants based on whether the restaurant can accommodate all of the group members' allergies and dietary restrictions.

Suppose that Alejandra is using DineOutHelper to organize a meal with Brandon and Cynthia.
Which of the following data are needed for DineOutHelper to recommend a restaurant for the group?

1) Each group member's list of food allergies or dietary restrictions
2) Alejandra's geographic location

1) Audio signal of the customer's voice
2) The customer's keypad selection
3) The customer's phone number

# Problem 3:

The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other.
