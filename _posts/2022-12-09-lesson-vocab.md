# Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms
Bits: The smallest unit of data that a computer can process and solve
Bytes: Unit of data that is 8 binary digits long
Hexadecimal: Numbering system that uses base 16
Nibbles: 4 consectutive binary digits
Binary Numbers: Numbering system that just uses 1s and 0s
Unsigned Integer: Integers but have the property that they have a sign attached to them
Signed Integer: 32 bit data that encodes an integer in a specific range
Floating Point: Positive or negative whole numbers
#### Binary Data Abstractions: 
Boolean: True or false statements
ASCII: American Standard Code for Information interchange, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers
Unicode: International encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs
RGB: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of red, green, and blue can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity.
### Data Compression: 
Lossy, Lossless (not discussed)
# Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms
Variables: Values that can change, depending on the conditions and code written. Often assigned by the programmer.
Data Types: A particular kind of data item, can be defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it. 
Assignment Operators: Used to assign values, functions, and variables to something. 
### Managing Complexity with Variables:  
Lists: A sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name.
2D Lists: A two-dimensional list can also be used to store objects, which is especially convenient for programming sketches that involve some sort of “grid” or “board”
Dictionaries: A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value
Class: Extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior
Algorithms: Step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions that must be carried out in a specific order to produce the desired result
Sequence: Order that commands are executed by a computer, allows us to carry out tasks that have multiple steps
Selection: Programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met
Iteration: Sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved
Expressions: A combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value
Comparison Operators: Operators that compare two expressions and return a Boolean value that represents the relationship of their values
Booleans Expressions and Selection:
Booleans Expressions and Iteration:
Truth Tables: a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. You can produce truth tables for parts of a circuit to check the logic at any stage.
Characters: Display unit of information equating to one alphabetic letter or symbol
Strings: Traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable
Length: Code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits
Concatenation: Means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings 
If: A conditional statement that only runs the code specified unless the defined conditons are met
Else: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Elif: used in conditional statements (if statements), and is short for else if
Nested Selection Statements: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task
Traversing Strings: To traverse a string means to accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript. A string can be traversed using for loop or while loop.
### Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements
Python For: A loop that 
While loops with Range:
Combining loops with conditionals to Break:
Continue: Code that is written when the programmer wants to force the program to move on
Procedural Abstraction: Breaking up code in different pieces to add modularity with procedures
Python Def procedures: Def is used when defining a function/procedure in python
Parameters: Input values that help functions and procedures know what values to work with.
Return Values: What a procedure gives as an output/resut.
