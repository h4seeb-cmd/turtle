### Licenses Notes
Licenses are documents that describe the conditions to how you can use the intellectual property it's attached to. There are many different types of licesnes, and those licenses allow for different things. For most of my GitHub repositories, they have an Apache 2.0 License.

The convenient thing about GitHub is that it shows you the license you are using the intellectual property of choice under. As you can see with this Apache 2.0 license here, I can use it for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use. I can't use it for trademarking, liability, or warranty. With different licenses, come different terms and conditions.

### Pros and Cons of Copyright and Licenses
Pros:
- People get credit for their own work.
- People can crack down on intellectual property theft easier.
- The creators can get money for their own work.
Cons:
- The whole system can be abused very easily.
- Greatly limits creative freedom and liberties.
- Companies abuse copyright protection to defend things that don't violate any copyright laws.
