      <td>I gave this person a 0 because their response was very short in minimal. They gave super basic and short answers. However Collegeboard gave it a 1 becasue although the response itself was very short, it hit all the requirements it needed to.</td>

      <td>The response did not meet the criteria of explaining why lists are important for managing complexity. Additionally, the list failed at managing complexity in the program, as you can simply rewrite the list to be an if statement to set the cpuPlay variable based on a random number.</td>

      <td>Row 5</td>
      <td>0</td>

Additionally, the description written is inaccurate as the identified list stateList appears to represent only the state name.</td>

Secondly, the response describes the two separate operations being performed by the user, but not conditions being tested by the given parameter.</td>
