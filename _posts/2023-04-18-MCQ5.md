# Corrections

### Question 14
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq5q14.png)

My answer was wrong as while removing four links could isolate computer F from computer E, 4 is not the minimum number required to accomplish this. 3 was correct, as Aay line between two computers represents a way for them to communicate with each other, and a communication between two computers can go through other computers. If the links from F to G, from F to A, and from F to E were broken, it would not be possible for computers E and F to communicate.

### Question 26

This option is correct. This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.

### Question 30

This option is correct. Each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called once before the loop, and then four times inside the loop (once for each of the four entries in One word, genre List). Therefore, the program will take approximately 5 hours to execute.

### Question 33

This option is correct. The flowchart sets include to true whenever floor is greater than 1 0 or bedrooms equal 3, and sets include to false otherwise. Therefore, the algorithm is equivalent to Include, left arrow, open parenthesis, floor greater than 10, close parenthesis, OR, open parenthesis, bedrooms equal 3, close parenthesis

### Question 43
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq5q43.png)

This option is correct. The pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. 

### Question 44
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq5q44.png)

This option is correct. With a 4-bit integer representation, 2 to the fourth power values can be represented, which allows for the values between 0 to 1 5, inclusive. If an operation results in a value greater than 1 5, an overflow error will occur. Of the operations given in the options, only 10 plus 7 gives a result larger than 1 5.

### Question 56
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq5q56.png)

This option is correct. The value of count starts at 1 and increases by twos, so it counts odd integers. The loop iterates 10 times, adding each intermediate value of count each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the odd integers starting at 1 and ending at 19.

### Question 57
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq5q57.png)

The correct answer is B. This expression concatenates the first two letters of Open quotation, Harp, close quotation with the last three letters of Open quotation, puppy, close quotation, resulting in Open quotation, Happy, close quotation.
