# Data Compression

This quiz was very quick for me, and honestly, the only really slightly challenging question was #3. I got the correct answer C, as although fewer bits may be stored, information is not necessarily lost when lossy compression is applied to an image. Additionally, the fact that it stores less bits makes the page render the info faster, I really just used basic logic here.


# Extracting Information

This quiz overall was pretty difficult, although I did get a 100% on it. Some of the hard questions were:

Question 1:
I got the answer A. This was correct because the unique identifier would be required in order to distinguish between two students with the same first and last names. If that's not there, the program would get confused.

Question 3:
For this question, I get the answers B and C. This is because different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.
