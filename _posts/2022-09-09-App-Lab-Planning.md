## Ideas for My Quiz (9/9/22)

- Short, text based questions.
- Mix CS questions with some other, random questions.
- A quiz about CS vocab?
- A math quiz? 

## My Plan for How I Would Make My Quiz (9/9/22)

- Have a question on the top, have a box where user types answer.
- If correct, lead to a correct screen and vice versa.
- Keep score by using variables.
- At the end, display the score the user obtained.

## Completed Tangible (9/11/22)

As of the date, the quiz is now complete: https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/byjBO37c2ri4OQLnzNk4YrF40bVfgn9oxhQbJa8_aRg. I added a mix bag of questions that vary from CS terminology to mathematical questions. Some challenges I faced while working were:

> - Not having my score tallied correctly at the end card
> - Hitting submit indiscriminately sent you to the correct screen, regardless of answer
> - Suffering from organizational issues

In order to overcome these challenges, I had to do lots of debugging. For one, I labled most of the components in my quiz, as my lack of organization really started to weigh me down later on. In order to fix the submit button only sending you to the correct screen, I had to use the getText code to run a check through the user input.

## Improvements I Should Keep in Mind for the Future

Some things I could have done better were:
> - Make the quiz more visually appealing
> - Manage my work time better
> - Write better, more robust code

## Some Ideas I Could Create in AppLab in the Future

Some ideas I have consist of:
> - Making a calculator
> - Making an image generator
> - Making a cookie clicker game

## Thoughts on AppLab

I feel like AppLab is a great concept and tool for those taking their first steps into CS, but I feel like because it's not using an actual language, there's not a lot of room for going above and beyond. Looking for ways to improve my code, and advice as to how to do certain things online was nigh impossible, as there isn't too much documentation on the way AppLab works at a higher level. At the end of the day, this feels like a Dollar Tree, less robust version of Scratch.
