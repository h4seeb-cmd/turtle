# Methodologhy
Instead of doing the practice MCQ for studying, I opted for a more traditional method of AP exam prepration. I tried working a little on the MCQ, however it was not helpful. As I was working on it, I felt as if I was not getting any more understanding by trying to work through those problems. This is because for me, I figured out that my weakness lied in my concpetual understanding of the big ideas. I ended up taking notes on the different units and concepts, and for me, it was much more helpful than the practice MCQs.

# Takeaway
Something big I learned and mastered was binary conversions. I was really bad at them, and for the longest time, I did not have a grasp on the methodology. All the lessons on it were unclear for me, so I took time and tried to learn it the old-fashioned way. I learned that the key was to do MOD(the number). Then, you divide that number by two and repeat the process until you get to MOD(1). After evaluating that, you write out the numbers from bottom to top.
