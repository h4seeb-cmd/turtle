# 3.1 Variables and Assignment 
## Python
Variables can be anything, as they are merely placeholders for set values. 
> Strings, lists, booleans, and numbers
You must assign variables their values. In order to do this, follow the following format:
> variable name (should be one word or letter) = value
Once the variable is defined, you can recall this variable in various types of functions and conditions. Some examples include:
- Mathematical Expressions
- Dictionaries
- Functions on Lists
In Python you can use temporary variables to have interchanging variables as well. They can also be defined as float numbers, rather than just integers.
