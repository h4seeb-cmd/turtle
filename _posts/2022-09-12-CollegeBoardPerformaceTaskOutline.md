DISCLAIMER: IDEAS SUBJECT TO CHANGE


# Idea 1: Working Calculator

## Task Outline/Desc.

I was thinking about making an online calculator that can handle equations. It would also play nice, calming music in the background. It would also be cool if I could add a function to let the user play their own songs on the site by linking it to spotify. The equations

## College Board Requirements

### Program Purpose and Function

The purpose of this calculator is to assist people with mathematical calculations. The calculator will be robust, and the site will work seamlessly, to provide the user with the best experience possible.

### Data Abstraction

The data that will be stored is the integers inputed by the user. Once they hit the calculate button, the code will compile the user data and calculate the output. Additionally, the site will allow users to sign into their spotify. It will use this information to let the user play whatever song they want on the site, provided they sign in. 

### Managing Complexity

Ideally, my calculator should be able to calculate semi-complex equations using order of operations and print out the output. Adding the order of operations into the mix would spike up the complexity of the code. Additionally, the option to sign in to a Spotify account and play music would prove to be quite complex as well.

### Procedural Abstraction

The code will abstract user data from what they inputted, and it will also collect the user's Spotify details so that they can access their music playlists and play songs from the website UI. This will make the calculator more personalized, and it would add another level of depth to the project.

### Algorithm Implementation

The main algorithm in this website would work to calculate the solution to the equations users would input. There will be a secondary algorithm that will pull user data in order to let them access their Spotify from the calculator.

### Testing

In order to test my idea, I will screen record myself going through every function.

### Learning Preperation

In order to create this idea, I need to learn about:
- Integrations with other sites
- How to implement an order to the code's math
- How to further customize webpages
