# Corrections

### Question 1
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BI2Q1.png)

For this question, what tripped me up was the "store 75-100" wording. I believed that it refered to 75-100 in DECIMAL, when in reality it meant in binary digits. It's actually 7 bits, as 2^7 is 128, so it could hold 128 digits. 6 bits would not be enough as 2^6 is 64.

### Question 11

Honestly I just didn't know how to answer this one. I got this wrong because I didn't know that the attendance for a particular show can be calculated dividing the total dollar amount of all tickets sold by the average ticket price.

### Question 17

I was also confused as to how I got this one incorrect, however I can see why D was the correct answer. D works because for each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.

### Question 18

I got this question wrong, as A) will generate a list of e-mail addresses of the customers who purchased any product, not just the products that use AA batteries. The correct answer is D) as the information in the products list can be used to create a list of the product IDs of all products that use AA batteries. Since the products list and the purchases list have the product ID information in common, the list of product IDs can be used in the purchases list to create a list of customer IDs of all the customers who purchased products that use AA batteries. Finally, since the purchases list and the customers list have the customer ID in common, the list of customer IDs can be used to generate a list of e-mail addresses of the customers who purchased products that use AA batteries.

### Question 19

For this question, I just heavily overthought #3, and so I told myself it probably wasn't it, which was a mistake, as any ordering of the three steps will identify the correct restaurant. Sequence III will work. Sorting by rating will put the greatest customer rating at the top of the list. Then filtering by number of ratings will remove restaurants without any ratings. Then filtering by payment type will remove the restaurants that do not accept credit cards.

### Question 21

Honestly I just missed the "select 2 answers" part. I got the first answer correct, and for the same reason, the reversed sequence, (D) would work as well.
