  </li>

  <li>Algorithms: Step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions that must be carried out in a specific order to produce the desired result</li>

  <li>Booleans Expressions and Selection: Ture or false, compares data of any type as long as types are the same.</li>
  <li>Booleans Expressions and Iteration: and/or, not.</li>
  <li>Truth Tables: a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. You can produce truth tables for parts of a circuit to check the logic at any stage.</li>
  <li>Characters: Display unit of information equating to one alphabetic letter or symbol</li>
  <li>Strings: Traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable</li>
  <li>Length: Code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits</li>
  <li>Concatenation: Means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings</li>
  <li>If: A conditional statement that only runs the code specified unless the defined conditons are met</li>
  <li>Else: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
  <li>Elif: used in conditional statements (if statements), and is short for else if</li>
  <li>Nested Selection Statements: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task</li>
  <li>Traversing Strings: To traverse a string means to accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript. A string can be traversed using for loop or while loop.</li>
  <li>Upper: Upper bounds of a function</li>
  <li>Lower: Lower bounds of a fucntion

  </li>
  <li>Python For: A statement that is used to repeatedly execute code as long as the condition is satisfied.</li>
  <li>While loops with Range: A loop that itereates through the code specified in it’s body</li>
  <li>Combining loops with conditionals to Break:</li>
  <li>Continue: Code that is written when the programmer wants to force the program to move on</li>
  <li>Procedural Abstraction: Breaking up code in different pieces to add modularity with procedures</li>
  <li>Python Def procedures: Def is used when defining a function/procedure in python</li>
  <li>Parameters: Input values that help functions and procedures know what values to work with.</li>
  <li>Return Values: What a procedure gives as an output/resut.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="search">
<a class="anchor" href="#search" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sequential Search: search method that iterates through each index of a series of data (inefficient compared to binary)</li>
  <li>Binary Search: A search method that checks the median of a series of data to find the target value. If it’s less than the median, than the search algorithm ignores the median and anything greater and repeats. Vice versa if the target is greater than the median.

      <li>Exponential Efficiency (Bad): More work takes an exponential amount of time. 1 job = x2 time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
