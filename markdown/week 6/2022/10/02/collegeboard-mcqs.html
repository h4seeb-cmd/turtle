<h2 id="--the-pseudo-code">
<a class="anchor" href="#--the-pseudo-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- The Pseudo-Code</h2>
<p>I found that working with the psuedo-code proved to be a challenge for many reasons. For one, it was something I am not entirely familiar with, as I have had very little exposure and I have never actually used it for anything. Due to this sense of unfamiliarity, figuring out the logic behind certain pieces of code was very challenging for me.</p>

<h2 id="--the-word-problems">
<a class="anchor" href="#--the-word-problems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>- The Word Problems</h2>
<p>Additionally, I found that the word problems were also challenging for me. It felt like they were extremely bloated and there was some useless information for the purpose of throwing me off.</p>

<h1 id="overall-thoughts">
<a class="anchor" href="#overall-thoughts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overall Thoughts</h1>
<p>I think that I will definetely need to train myself to learn the CollegeBoard psuedocode a little bit more, as that will for sure show up on the AP exam. Additionally, I will have to get better at seeing the logic in code. In order to do that I must practice to analyze different pieces of code to pick apart their funciton. I should also strive to get better at the word problems, as they gave me quite a lot of trouble.</p>
