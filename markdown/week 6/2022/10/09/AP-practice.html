<p>I notice that I still need to work on understanding the Collegeboard code and understanding code logic. That is the main thing holding me back at the minute. I also need to work on my speed as well.</p>

<h1 id="problem-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem 1:</h1>

<p>DineOutHelper is a mobile application that people can use to select a restaurant for a group meal. Each user creates a profile with a unique username and a list of food allergies or dietary restrictions. Each user can then build a contact list of other users of the app.</p>

<p>A user who is organizing a meal with a group selects all the members of the group from the user’s contact list. The application then recommends one or more nearby restaurants based on whether the restaurant can accommodate all of the group members’ allergies and dietary restrictions.</p>

<p>Suppose that Alejandra is using DineOutHelper to organize a meal with Brandon and Cynthia.
Which of the following data are needed for DineOutHelper to recommend a restaurant for the group?</p>

<p>1) Each group member’s list of food allergies or dietary restrictions
2) Alejandra’s geographic location
3) The usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists</p>

<p>The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two computers that are not directly connected must go through at least one other computer. For example, information can be sent directly between computers A and B, but information sent between computers A and C must go through other computers.
What is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed in the network before computer E can no longer communicate with computer F?</p>

<p>1) 1
2) 3
3) 4
4) 2</p>
